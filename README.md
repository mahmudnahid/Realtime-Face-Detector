## Realtime Face Detector
This goal of this project is to build a face detector that alarms you when you have an unwanted visitor in your home.


## Setup
To run the code on your own machine, rather than using a managed notebook service like Colab, you will need to set up a development environment. ML and DL engineers should have some experience working with development environments, so it is beneficial to gain this skill beforehand.

**To set up the development environment on a local or remote machine, please follow the instructions in the setup folder's README.md file.**
